\section{Reachability/Controllability and Observability}

\subsection{Reachability/Controllability}

An LTI system is reachable if there exists a control signal that takes the system from an initial condition $x_0 = 0$ to any desired final state $x_f$, in finite time.

\begin{equation*}
    R:= \begin{bmatrix}
        B & AB & A^2B & A^3B & \cdots & A^{n-1}B
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Mathematically expressed, a system is reachable if and only if the reachability matrix $R$ has full row rank $n$.
\begin{align*}
    \text{rank}(R) & = n    \\
    \det(R)        & \neq 0
\end{align*}

The $i$-th mode of a system in diagonal form is reachable only if $\tilde{b}_i \neq 0$

\ptitle{Controllability}

An LTI system is controllable if, for any initial condition $x_0$, there exists a control input that brings the state $x$ to $0$ in finite time.

For continuous-time systems controllability and reachability are the same. However, for a discrete-time system with a non-invertible $A$ matrix there is a subtle difference. For example the DT system $x[k+1] = 0x[k] + 0u[k]$ is contr but unreachable.

\subsection{Observability}

An LTI system is observable if, for any initial condition $x_0$, this initial condition can be reconstructed uniquely based on the knowledge of the input and output signal over a finite time interval.

\begin{equation*}
    O:= \begin{bmatrix}
        C      \\
        CA     \\
        CA^2   \\
        \vdots \\
        CA^{n-1}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Mathematically expressed, a system is observable if and only if the observability matrix $O$ has full column rank $n$.
\begin{align*}
    \text{rank}(O) & = n    \\
    \det(O)        & \neq 0
\end{align*}

\ptitle{SISO diagonal systems}

The $i$-th mode of a system in diagonal form is observable only if $\tilde{c}_i \neq 0$

\subsection{Stabilizability and Detectability}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A system is stabilizable if all unstable modes are reachable.
    \item A system is detectable if all unstable modes are observable.
    \item In a system that is stabilizable and detectable all the modes that cannot be controlled and/or observed must behaving ``nicely'' on their own.
\end{itemize}
